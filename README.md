A customized Fantasy Football Draft for my league's funky rules and settings.
Most FFL drafts fall into one of a few categories, thus the systems that simulate to help people practice their drafts fit those molds.
Well, my league decided it would allow each team to keep three players from year to year from their previous roster, so to prepare for this year's draft, I needed to build a draft that would consider their actions preceeding the actual first round and how it would affect my decisions, as well as my own keepers.

This model still needs some work in terms of usability and user interface, but it is useful for people in my FFL league in 2022.
